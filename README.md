# Themes
I create [Google Chrome](https://chrome.com) and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) themes to enhance any users experience. I create many useful themes people are used to, so if you used [Discord](https://discordapp.com), you can get the [Discord Dark Theme](?) if you're used to that.

In my personal opinion, custom themes are the best. The boring default theme, I just can't handle it and find a theme to replace it with. I make my own themes, because, I like doing it and it's fun. You see, you never know something unless you try it. Download my themes sometime. It could be really helpful.

| Theme Name  | Description | Download |
| ------------ | -------------- | ---------- |
| **Discord Dark Theme**  | I recreated the Discord Dark Theme and made it into a Chrome and Edge theme. Kinda lame.  | [Download for Chrome](https://mega.nz/#!gwBm2CbD) or [Download for Edge](https://mega.nz/#!tsYUTI5Y) |
| **AnimeChrome**  | Ever dreamed of an Anime theme for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge? Well, I made one. applause  | [Download for Chrome](https://mega.nz/#!R5YyxaaD) |
